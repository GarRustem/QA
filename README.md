This repository contains some of my exercise solving for MySQL and Manual testing

Greetings!

In general way of my education as QA engineer, I studied from theory to practice by books (like «Тестирование программного обеспечения. Базовый курс», Святослав Куликов), with YouTube channels (freeCodeCamp.org, Artsiom Rusau QA Life, QA START UP and others) and official documentations from developers resources (Postman, Fiddler, Charles Proxy).
Additional, for studying MySQL, HTTP, API, OSI model and TCP/IP model, HTML and CSS, I have used many helpful resources such as w3schools.com, dev.mysql.com, htmlbook.ru, habr.com and stackoverflow.com.

For examples of MySQL exercises solving, I used to search certain commands and possible ways to apply them through dev.mysql.com and w3schools.com – I am not a professional yet, but able to find and use information to solve the task whether it refers to SQL, Postman or other tool :)

Thank you for your attention!
